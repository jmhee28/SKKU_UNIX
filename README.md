## Make file transfer
- The server runs in the background by attaching & when running
- It runs in the foreground and is shown on the screen
- This client is under an infinite loop with conditional exit(“quit”)
- When the name of the file is entered, the client reads the file and sends it to the server
- The server saves the file name received from the client by appending _copy
- The file is a text file and does not have an extension–ex) a.txt(X), b.exe(X), c.c(X) , Aladdin(O), a(O), b(O)
- The size of file is smaller than 200,000 bytes
- The length of file name is shorter than 50 byte
